# Talk2Table
This app lets user to talk to table. Initial version starts with talk2csv but then expands to databases as well

🧠 AI-Powered Query Response App
A modular Python project that processes user queries through a Streamlit interface using custom agents and data pipelines.

🚀 Features
📦 Modular design: Components for data preparation, query parsing, and agent tools
💡 Natural language query processing
🧱 Streamlit frontend for interactive querying

🧪 Customizable agents and tools

streamlit run app.py
🧠 Modules Overview
modules/agent_tools.py
→ Custom tools and functions used by agents to enhance or retrieve responses.

modules/data_preparation.py
→ Handles loading, cleaning, and embedding of data.

modules/query_processing.py
→ Interprets and routes user queries to the right logic or agent.

✅ Requirements
Python ≥ 3.8

streamlit

pandas, numpy

sentence-transformers or openai (if vector search is used)

any other libraries used inside your modules

(Add a requirements.txt file or install with pip freeze > requirements.txt)

🏗️ Extending
You can add new tools or data sources by extending:

agent_tools.py — to support new response functions

data_preparation.py — to preprocess different types of content

query_processing.py — to introduce new query intent recognition logic
